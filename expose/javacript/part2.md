# Data Types
12. Given the above Object, write the notation for:
    
    A. Accessing the value of the name property in the student object

    B. Accessing the value of the Grad Year property in the student object

    C. Calling the function for the greeting property in the student object

    D. Accessing the name property of the object in the Favorite Teacher property in student

    E. Access index zero in the array of the courseLoad property of the student object
# Basic Operators & Type Conversion 
13. Arithmetic
    
    A. ‘3’ + 2

    B. ‘3’ - 2

    C. 3 + null

    D. ‘3’ + null

    E. true + 3
    
    F. false + null
    
    G. '3' + undefined
    
    H. '3' - undefined

14. Comparison
    
    A. ‘2’ > 1
    
    B. ‘2’ < ‘12’
    
    C. 2 == ‘2’
    
    D. 2 === ‘2’
    
    E. true == 2
    
    F. true === Boolean(2)
15. Explain the difference between the == and === operators.

# Loop

16. Given the above Object, write a for...in loop that will iterate through it and print out the value of the property if the property starts with the letter r, or if the value of that property is an odd number.  (This should be in a JS file part2-question16.js)
    
# Functions
17. If the function above is called with the following parameters modifyArray([1,2,3], doSomething), what will be the result? Briefly walk through how you arrived at that result. (This should be in your part2.md). Here we are passing in a function as a parameter, however we can also return a function from another function just as easily, you're encouraged to play around with callbacks as they are used heavily in frontend JS development. 

# setInterval(), setTimeout(), clearTimeout()
18. The above program only prints out the time once when executed. Modify this code such that the program prints out the time every second. 
19. What is the output of the above code? (This should be in your part2.md)
